Linking JEM, the BEE statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based on JEM, the BEE. 
 Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.

 As a special exception, the copyright holders of JEM, the BEE give you permission to combine JEM, the BEE program with 
 free software programs or libraries that are released under the GNU LGPL and with independent modules 
 that communicate with JEM, the BEE solely through the 'org.pepstock.jem.jbpm.tasks.JemWorkItem' interface. 
 You may copy and distribute such a system following the terms of the GNU GPL for JEM, the BEE and the licenses 
 of the other code concerned, provided that you include the source code of that other code when and as 
 the GNU GPL requires distribution of source code and provided that you do not modify the 
 'org.pepstock.jem.jbpm.tasks.JemWorkItem' interface.

 Note that people who make modified versions of JEM, the BEE are not obligated to grant this special exception
 for their modified versions; it is their choice whether to do so. The GNU General Public License
 gives permission to release a modified version without this exception; this exception also makes it
 possible to release a modified version which carries forward this exception. If you modify the 
 'org.pepstock.jem.jbpm.tasks.JemWorkItem' interface, this exception does not apply to your modified version of 
 JEM, the BEE, and you must remove this exception when you distribute your modified version.

 This exception is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version 3
 (“GPLv3”)
